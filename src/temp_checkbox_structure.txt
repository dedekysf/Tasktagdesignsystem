Checkbox Structure:
1. Variant 1 (Circular - Basic without label)
2. Variant 2 (Circular - With Label)  
3. Size (Note: Checkboxes don't have size variants, so this will show the fixed 20px size)
4. States (Default, Disabled)

Radio Button Structure:
1. Variant 1 (Basic without label)
2. Variant 2 (With Label)
3. Size (Note: Radio doesn't have size variants, so this will show the fixed 20px size)
4. States (Default, Disabled)

Dropdown/TextInput/TextArea Structure:
1. Variant 1 (Basic - without label, without icon)
2. Variant 2 (With Label - without icon)
3. Size (sm, md)
4. States (Required, Error, Disabled) - and with icon versions

Actually, looking at the components:
- Checkbox has variant prop for circular/rectangular - these are the 2 main variants
- Radio Button doesn't have a variant prop - only 1 variant
- Dropdown/TextInput/TextArea have 5 variants but also have icon/no-icon versions

For Checkbox, since it has 2 shape variants (circular vs rectangular), maybe:
Section 1: Circular Basic (without label)
Section 2: Circular With Label
Section 3: Rectangular Basic (without label)  
Section 4: Rectangular With Label
And then States showing both variants in disabled state?

OR keep it simpler as user requested:
Section 1: Basic (without label) - showing both circular and rectangular
Section 2: With Label - showing both circular and rectangular
Section 3: Size - showing the fixed size
Section 4: States - showing disabled state for both variants

I'll go with the simpler approach focusing on label/no-label as the main distinction.
